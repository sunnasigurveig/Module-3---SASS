# Module-3---SASS

I used Bibi's idea of using a already made HTML and CSS website from the Codeacademy. It really helped time wise and as well as with less confusion.
I liked the SCSS structure but I do need more time and information to understand it better. I also need more time to understand HTML and CSS. But hopefully I will get there sooner than later.
I hope I atleast made the bare minimum for this assignment since it took a loooong time for me.
